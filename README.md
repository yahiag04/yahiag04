# Yahia Ghallale

## Who am I
Computer Science & Engineering student (Italy) focused on building production-grade AI systems.  
My goal is to become an AI Engineer working on real-world, high-impact problems (computer vision, applied ML, data systems, and scalable backends).  
I care about end-to-end ownership: from data and models to deployment and products.

## What I’m working on
- **Computer Vision**: object detection/tracking pipelines (RF-DETR, YOLO, ByteTrack-style workflows).
- **Medical AI**: CNNs for X-ray/MRI classification and triage-oriented decision support.
- **AI Systems**: RAG and semantic search pipelines (scrape → embed → search).
- **Full-stack**: backend services and dashboards to serve models and visualize results.
- **Embedded/IoT**: ESP32/Arduino sensor projects with cloud connectivity and apps.

Selected themes: model training, evaluation, inference optimization, data pipelines, and simple but solid deployment.

## Tools I use
**Languages**
- Python, C/C++, JavaScript, SQL

**ML / Data**
- PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-learn
- Experiment tracking, dataset versioning, basic MLOps practices

**Backend / Web**
- Node.js, Express, REST APIs
- PostgreSQL
- Basic frontend for dashboards (HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap)

**Systems / Dev**
- Git, Docker
- Linux/macOS
- ESP32 / Arduino for embedded prototypes
